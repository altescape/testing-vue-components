# Testing Vue Components and Vuex

Code from course on testing Vue with Jest - I've added some iterations to the testing with Vuex (look at salad bowl) where testing the store and testing inputs and form submissions that affect the state/store.

- [salad spec](https://github.com/altescape/testing-vue-components/blob/master/specs/salad.spec.js)
- [salad bowl component](https://github.com/altescape/testing-vue-components/blob/master/src/salad-bowl.vue)

[watch the testing course](https://vueschool.io/courses/learn-how-to-test-vuejs-components).
